# Pre-Employment Coding Quiz Project
---------------------------------------
## Description:

### This project was intended to combine all our learned skills to date, to create a functional, yet basic, replication of a quiz that an employer might administer to filter out unqualified applicants.
-----------------------------------------
## Deployment:

### Due to a time constraint, I decided to abandon a redirect to a separate, dedicated scoreboard page. Final commit and deployment currently do not have scoreboard functionality (beyond a title and a "null" return), but will be updated for this at a later date.
